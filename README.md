# Hangman
This is a program I put together using WPF and the MVVM design pattern.

It's a simple Hangman game that executes against a web api to retrieve a random word for use with each game!

In order to compmile and run, you may need the latest version of Newtonsoft.Json (Json.Net) installed which can be done through the NuGet Package Manager within Visual Studio: PM> Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json

Enjoy!
